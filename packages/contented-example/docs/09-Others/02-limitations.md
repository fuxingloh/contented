# Known Limitations

## Customization

Since the purpose of Contented is to encourage authoring through a set of tools and workflows, the outcome has always
been for engineers to produce more markdowns (_.md) or processed prose (`_.json`). The focus is never about building a
complete documentation website.

In fact, you should take the output(s) of [`contented build`](./03-api.md#contented-build) that are published into npm; and pull them
into your main/official website for re-presentation (`npm i, import from`). Remember, the prose/content/narrative
created is what's valuable here. Design can easily change, but your content stands the test of time.
