# Remark Frontmatter

This is a test file with frontmatter where `title` and `description` will automatically be extracted if they are
present and not explicitly set in the `---` configuration. This is useful for SEO purposes where descriptions and
titles are important but not always explicitly set in the markdown frontmatter.
